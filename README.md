# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Project Requirements

- [x] The solution should lock once all correct answers have been selected so the toggles can no longer be switched
- [] The toggles should animate between the two states (see attached video)
- [] The background colour should change in proportion to how "correct" the answer is (see video attached)
- [] The component should be responsive down to screens 320px wide

Extra:

- Use UUID library for unique IDs
